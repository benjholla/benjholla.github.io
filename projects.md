[JReFrameworker](http://ben-holland.com/JReFrameworker/) is an Eclipse plugin for creating and building projects that allow the user to write annotated Java source that is automatically merged or inserted into the runtime. It was designed as a more user friendly way to write managed code rootkits (MCRs) for the Java runtime. The framework supports developing and debugging attack modules directly in the Eclipse IDE.

## BrewLog

[BrewLog](https://github.com/benjholla/BrewLog) is a public homebrew log with version control!  I built BrewLog as an extension to the [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) theme to track my homebrew beer and wine measurements as well as tasting notes, but it's ready to be forked and deployed free on Github by anyone.

## QuestionableCode.org

[QuestionableCode.org](https://questionablecode.org) is project to audit every Android binary application installed on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 tablet.

## Cyber Defense Competition Web Apps
