[JReFrameworker](https://ben-holland.com/JReFrameworker/) is an Eclipse plugin for creating projects that allow the user to write annotated Java source that is automatically merged or inserted into the Java runtime. It was designed as a more user friendly way to write managed code rootkits (MCRs) for the Java runtime environment. The framework supports developing and debugging attack modules directly in the Eclipse IDE.

## Atlas Plugins

I've written a few plugins for [Atlas](http://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas/) (a program analysis framework).

- [AtlasWBP](https://ben-holland.com/AtlasWBP/) - An Atlas frontend for processing Java WAR binaries.
- [Toolbox Commons](https://ensoftcorp.github.io/toolbox-commons/) - A set of common utilities for program analysis using Atlas.
- [Starter Toolbox](https://github.com/EnSoftCorp/Starter-Toolbox) - A barebone starter toolbox for building a domain specific toolbox on top of Atlas. This plugin supports a headless bulk analysis mode.
- [Software Metrics](https://github.com/benjholla/SoftwareMetricsAssignment) - A program analysis assignment to calcuate software architecture metrics for afferent and efferent coupling.
- [Android Essentials Toolbox](https://ensoftcorp.github.io/android-essentials-toolbox/) - A set of building blocks for analyzing Android apps with Atlas. This plugin implements a mapping of Android permissions to their corresponding API methods for multiple versions of Android.
- [Points-to Toolbox](https://ensoftcorp.github.io/points-to-toolbox/) - An Atlas native points-to analysis and utilities for enabling client analyses.
- [Call Graph Toolbox](https://ensoftcorp.github.io/call-graph-toolbox) - A toolbox for visually experimenting with implementations of nine different call graph construction algorithms using partial or whole program analysis.

## BrewLog&nbsp;/&nbsp;SoapLog

[BrewLog](https://github.com/benjholla/BrewLog) is a public homebrew log with version control!  I built BrewLog as an extension to the [Jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) theme to track my homebrew beer and wine measurements as well as tasting notes, but it's ready to be forked and deployed free on Github by anyone. [SoapLog](https://github.com/benjholla/SoapLog) extends BrewLog for a public soaping log with an integrated lye calculator and version control.

## QuestionableCode.org

[QuestionableCode.org](https://questionablecode.org) is project to audit every Android binary application installed on a Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 tablet.

## Cyber Defense Competition Scenarios

I've developed several vulnerable web applications and challenge anomalies for use in cyber defense competitions at Iowa State University.  For more details see [https://github.com/ISEAGE-ISU](https://github.com/ISEAGE-ISU).
