A quick review of 2016. This year started off slow, but I didn't think so at the time. 

Continuing my PhD program, my Spring semester consisted of two work intensive courses (Formal Methods and Fundamentals of Program Analysis), assisting in teaching an undergraduate course in Software Evolution and Maintenance for 10 hours a week, and working 20 hours a week on our [DARPA Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC)](http://www.darpa.mil/program/space-time-analysis-for-cybersecurity) project. In February, DARPA hauled us in to their headquarters in Arlington, Virginia for a week of challenges to audit the Red team's program binaries for vulnerabilities. Immediately after we were given 6 months to continue our audits and improve our results. By the end of the semester I was surviving minute to minute barely finishing my projects before their deadlines. While I made it through and everything worked out fine, it was the most stressful semester in all of my 11 years at Iowa State University combined (side note: I've been here too long). 

To make matters worse the Spring semester was filled with rejection, frustration, and tragedy for me personally. My talks and paper submissions got decent reviews but ended up being rejected, and when one got accepted I was asked to withdraw it. I don't want to discuss the tragedy publicly, but through some hard work and a bit of serendipity all of these things eventually worked out for the better.

In May, I attended the invite only [Sixth Summer School on Formal Techniques](http://fm.csl.sri.com/SSFT16/) in Menlo, CA, which is a week long summer school taught by the leading experts in the field. Shortly after I was notified that my talk, which was previously rejected at a smaller conference had found a home at [DEFCON](https://www.defcon.org/html/defcon-24/dc-24-speakers.html#Holland) (my ultimate goal as a speaker and perhaps the largest and most well known computer security conference in the nation). Around the same time I was also invited to attend the [US Cyber Challenge's Western Regional Cyber Security Boot Camp](http://www.uscyberchallenge.org/) in Cedar City, Utah because of my performance in a national online cybersecurity competition. I booked travel from Ames to Cedar City to Seattle to Las Vegas and finally back to Ames in what would be the start of many more travel engagements this year. 

While this was my third time attending the US Cyber Challenge Security Boot Camp, I still learned a lot (which is why I keep coming back!) and I expectantly got a chance to be an instructor for half day when one of the instructors was having problems with a binary exploitation example and handed the course off to me because I had previously prepared a similar lab exercise and was able to demonstrate the exploit on-the-fly. From Utah I went to visit a good friend in Seattle for a few days before it was off the the crazy world of Las Vegas to present at DEFCON. 

True to form, DEFCON was a huge affair with an [estimated 22 thousand attendees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEF_CON#Venues.2C_dates_and_attendance)! After poking my nose in one of the main track rooms where I was supposed to present the next day and counting the number of seats I had a small 3 second long panic attack (napkin math: 25 seats per row on each side of the aisle and about 60 rows gave me 2 &times; 25 &times; 60 &#61; 3000 seats per room!). Considering myself a seasoned speaker at this point, this was an unusual feeling for me. In retrospect I think I had a little bit of [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) at the time. Long story short, despite the fact I was the first talk Saturday morning after Friday's late night party and I was competing with a well known security researcher with one of the more anticipated talks, I ended up filling a little shy of &frac23; of the room and most importantly the talk went very well (ignoring the fact that I absentmindedly forgot to show the grand finale demo that I had spent several weeks developing...). It was also the first time I had received two personal job offers before I had a chance to leave the room after speaking.

**Note:** There are still a few noteworthy events that started this year that I'm not quite ready to share yet because they are still unfolding. Life is always full of twists and turns.
