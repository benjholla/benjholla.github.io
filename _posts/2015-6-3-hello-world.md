I did it. I made a blog.

I've been back and forth on the idea of having a website for a long time.  I like the idea of having a central place to list projects and random thoughts, but I don't like maintaining code just for a personal website or having to worry about security updates for WordPress or a similar platform.  Then one day I came across [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll-Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and it all clicked. Now I'm in love with the combination of Markdown, version control, generated static content, and free content hosting through GitHub.

I figure I will use this space to post thoughts that might be useful to others (or even just the future me). I also intend to revise my thoughts (posts) to reflect my current thinking.

With respect to this site, I'd also add:
