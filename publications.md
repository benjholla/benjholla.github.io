**Talk:** [<a href="#" class="hover-tooltip" tip="Think twice before you optimize that code!  You might just give away the farm. Side channel attacks were traditionally used to reverse engineer cryptographic hardware circuits using power analysis, but more recently timing information is being used to deduce the sensitive inner workings of software. The steady stream of side channel exploits coming out academia and the security community continue to demonstrate the seriousness of the problem and DARPA's current Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program indicates that we need a solution now. Let’s take a look at a few real examples of information leakage through side channel attacks in web apps and learn to spot them together.  If there's a hole in your bucket, then fix it, dear Henry.">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Slides](../slides/Examining_Side_Channel_Leaks_in_Web_Apps.pdf)]
