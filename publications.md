## Upcoming
- Benjamin Holland, Amber Aldrich. **Homebrewing for Hackers** *[Derbycon 5.0](https://www.derbycon.com/derbycon-2015-schedule-and-abstract/)*, Louisville, Kentucky, September 2015.<br/>
**Talk:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]
<p class="abstract">It has been a few years now since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y">int eighty told us to drink all the booze and hack all the things</a>.  Well there are plenty of things left to hack, but the cost of booze is really adding up.  Come learn how you can cheaply and easily brew your own booze from the many varieties of beer to a Viking mead.  We will even touch a little on the legal and historical side of homebrewing.  Did you know it's legal to brew your own in all 50 states as long as you don't sell it? Well you will when we give FREE BEER* to a few lucky attendees because we can't legally sell it to you! That's right FREE as in BEER. Finally we are open sourcing a markdown based homebrew log built on the Git version control system so you can publicly record your beer measurements and automatically calculate the alcohol content! *Some molecular assembly required. Must be 21 years of age. Not enough beer for everyone.</p>

- Benjamin Holland. **There's a hole in my bucket, dear Liza - Examining side channel leaks in web apps.** *[OWASP Ames](https://owaspames.org/2015/08/07/augusts-meeting-theres-a-hole-in-my-bucket-dear-liza-examining-side-channel-leaks-in-web-apps/)*, Ames, IA, August 2015.<br/>
**Talk:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Slides](../slides/Examining_Side_Channel_Leaks_in_Web_Apps.pdf)]
<p class="abstract">Think twice before you optimize that code! You might just give away the farm. Side channel attacks were traditionally used to reverse engineer cryptographic hardware circuits using power analysis, but more recently timing information is being used to deduce the sensitive inner workings of software. The steady stream of side channel exploits coming out academia and the security community continue to demonstrate the seriousness of the problem and DARPA's current Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program indicates that we need a solution now. Let's take a look at a few real examples of information leakage through side channel attacks in web apps and learn to spot them together. If there's a hole in your bucket, then fix it, dear Henry.</p>

<p class="abstract">This paper presents a demo of our Security Toolbox to detect novel malware in Android apps. This Toolbox is developed through our recent research project funded by the DARPA Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) project. The adversarial challenge ("Red") teams in the DARPA APAC program are tasked with designing sophisticated malware to test the bounds of malware detection technology being developed by the research and development ("Blue") teams. Our research group, a Blue team in the DARPA APAC program, proposed a "human-in-the-loop program analysis" approach to detect malware given the source or Java bytecode for an Android app. Our malware detection apparatus consists of two components: a general-purpose program analysis platform called Atlas, and a Security Toolbox built on the Atlas platform. This paper describes the major design goals, the Toolbox components to achieve the goals, and the workflow for auditing Android apps. The accompanying video illustrates features of the Toolbox through a live audit.</p>

**Paper:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[PDF](../papers/A_Human-in-the-loop_Approach_for_Resolving_Complex_Software_Anomalies.pdf)]
<p class="abstract">Automated static analysis tools are widely used in identifying software anomalies, such as memory leak, unsafe thread synchronization and malicious behaviors in smartphone applications. Such anomaly-prone scenarios can be bifurcated into: "ordinary" (analysis requires relatively simple automation) and "complex" (analysis poses extraordinary automation challenges). While automated static analysis tools can resolve ordinary scenarios with high accuracy, automating the analysis of complex scenarios can be very challenging and, at times, infeasible. Even when feasible the cost for full automation can be exorbitant: either in implementing the automation or in sifting through the large number of erroneous results manually. Instead, we appeal for a "Human-in-the-loop" approach called "Amplified Reasoning Technique" (ART). While some of the existing approaches do involve human in the analysis process, the roles played by man and machine are mainly segregated. Whereas, ART puts man and machine in a "loop" in an interactive and visualization-based fashion. This paper makes an attempt to convince its readers to make their analysis of software anomalies ART-based by presenting real-world case studies of complex anomalies and how an ART based approach can be very effective in resolving them. The case studies highlight the desired characteristics of an ART based tool and the type of role it plays in amplifying human intelligence.</p>

- Benjamin Holland, Suresh Kothari. **A Bug or Malware? Catastrophic consequences either way.** *[Derbycon 4.0](https://www.derbycon.com/schedule_2014/)*, Louisville, Kentucky, September 2014.<br/>
**Talk:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J4D7YJ1IE4)]&nbsp;[[Slides](../slides/A_Bug_or_Malware.pdf)]
<p class="abstract">We live in an age of software problems with catastrophic consequences. An extra goto in Apple's SSL implementation comprised certificate checks for the better part of a year. An erroneous integer conversion in the Ariane 5 launch destroyed the European Space Agency rocket and its cargo valued at 500 million dollars. Often the problem is just a few lines of code and looking for it is like searching for a needle in the haystack. Moreover the problems are often so subtle that it is difficult to tell if the problem is intentionally malicious or an honest mistake. The traditional approach to malware detection fails to detect such catastrophic problems. To make matters worse, the problem can remain dormant and can easily evade testing. The recently exposed Heartbleed problem in OpenSSL has existed since 2011. It is an open challenge to discover these subtle but catastrophic problems in software. In this talk, Iowa State University researchers involved with DARPA's Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) project will discuss their approach to address this challenge. This approach enables a unique combination of automated software analysis and human intelligence. The approach will be concretely demonstrated by its use to detect subtle problems in Android applications.</p>
