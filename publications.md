<p class="abstract">Think twice before you optimize that code! You might just give away the farm. Side channel attacks were traditionally used to reverse engineer cryptographic hardware circuits using power analysis, but more recently timing information is being used to deduce the sensitive inner workings of software. The steady stream of side channel exploits coming out academia and the security community continue to demonstrate the seriousness of the problem and DARPA's current Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program indicates that we need a solution now. Let’s take a look at a few real examples of information leakage through side channel attacks in web apps and learn to spot them together. If there's a hole in your bucket, then fix it, dear Henry.</p>

<p class="abstract">This paper presents a demo of our Security Toolbox to detect novel malware in Android apps. This Toolbox is developed through our recent research project funded by the DARPA Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) project. The adversarial challenge ("Red") teams in the DARPA APAC program are tasked with designing sophisticated malware to test the bounds of malware detection technology being developed by the research and development ("Blue") teams. Our research group, a Blue team in the DARPA APAC program, proposed a "human-in-the-loop program analysis" approach to detect malware given the source or Java bytecode for an Android app. Our malware detection apparatus consists of two components: a general-purpose program analysis platform called Atlas, and a Security Toolbox built on the Atlas platform. This paper describes the major design goals, the Toolbox components to achieve the goals, and the workflow for auditing Android apps. The accompanying video illustrates features of the Toolbox through a live audit.</p>
