## 2015

- <a name="ASE2015"></a>Suresh Kothari, Benjamin Holland. **Computer-aided Collaborative Validation of Large Software.** *The 30th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering ([ASE 2015](http://ase2015.unl.edu/#computer-aided-collaborative-validation-tutorial))*, Lincoln, Nebraska, November 2015.<br/>
**Tutorial:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Materials](https://goo.gl/S7e5VG)]
<div class="abstract"><p>Neither manual nor totally automated discovery of software vulnerabilities is practical. Manual discovery requires extremely laborious work by highly skilled software analysts and totally automated discovery is riddled with intractable problems.</p><p>This tutorial introduces a novel practical approach for machine-enabled human-in-the-loop discovery of software vulnerabilities, and is based on "amplifying human intelligence" rather than trying to replace human intelligence. The approach is supported by a suite of tools with unique capabilities that enable human analysts to quickly identify and understand the relevant parts of large software and perform "what-if experiments" in order to discover highly sophisticated vulnerabilities.  These tools are advanced through large Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) projects and their effectiveness has been demonstrated for discovering sophisticated malware challenges.</p></div>

**Tutorial:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Materials](https://goo.gl/eJ4f2B)]
<div class="abstract"><p>This tutorial is aimed at the audience interested in knowing how software reliability and cybersecurity converge in terms of intrinsic hard problems, and how that knowledge can be useful for advancing the research and practice in both fields. This tutorial is based on our research in three Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) projects and our practical experience of applying the research. The tutorial will provide succinct understanding of the "hardness" through representative problems and by introducing a programming language agnostic notion of an intrinsic hardness spectrum derived from fundamental impediments to detecting vulnerabilities accurately. About 60% of the tutorial will be demonstrations to elaborate on the hardness spectrum and its practical applicability. The representative problems will pertain to reliability issues for operating system kernels and malware attacks on Android apps. We will introduce the use of a powerful program comprehension tool to derive the hardness spectrum by mapping the Java, C, and Java bytecode to high-level entities that reveal the inner workings of complex software.</p></div>

**Tutorial:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Materials](https://github.com/benjholla/MILCOM2015)]
<div class="abstract"><p>The growing threat of malware in embedded systems and the possibility of adversaries crafting one-of-a-kind sophisticated malware as a catastrophic cyberweapon makes malware detection a high priority topic for advanced research, college education, and professional training. There is a need for automated detection tools for commercial applications as well as a need for sophisticated apparatus to discover evasive malware targeted at defense applications. With those needs in mind, this tutorial will show the participants how to effectively deploy program analyses for cybersecurity.</p><p>The tutorial will be filled with interesting demonstrations of practical techniques, their applicability and limitations, and the underlying formal framework for future advances. We will discuss a novel and easy-to-understand graph paradigm of program analysis as the backbone of the framework. We will introduce <a href="http://www.ensoftcorp.com/atlas/">Atlas</a>, a platform designed to deploy the graph paradigm effectively. We will show how Atlas makes it easy to develop automated tools by taking away the burden of programming low-level program analysis constructs. We will demonstrate the Android Security Toolbox, an Atlas plug-in, as a sophisticated apparatus we developed through the <a href="http://www.darpa.mil/program/automated-program-analysis-for-cybersecurity">DARPA APAC</a> program.</p><p>The participants will get a hands-on experience in the powerful applicability of the graph paradigm through Atlas by observing its use to perform visual graph interactions or write small graph traversal programs to perform analyses that would otherwise take days of conventional programming. Researchers, college professors, and professional practitioners will find that they can build on the tutorial material and incorporate the graph program analysis paradigm to foster their special interests in research, teaching, or professional practice.</p></div>

<div class="abstract"><p>It has been a few years now since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoUWHfh733Y">int eighty told us to drink all the booze and hack all the things</a>.  Well there are plenty of things left to hack, but the cost of booze is really adding up.  Come learn how you can cheaply and easily brew your own booze from the many varieties of beer to a Viking mead.  We will even touch a little on the legal and historical side of homebrewing.  Did you know it's legal to brew your own in all 50 states as long as you don't sell it? Well you will when we give FREE BEER* to a few lucky attendees because we can't legally sell it to you! That's right FREE as in BEER. Finally we are open sourcing a markdown based homebrew log built on the Git version control system so you can publicly record your beer measurements and automatically calculate the alcohol content!</p><p><b>*</b><i>Some molecular assembly required. Must be 21 years of age. Not enough beer for everyone.</i></p></div>

<div class="abstract"><p>Think twice before you optimize that code! You might just give away the farm. Side channel attacks were traditionally used to reverse engineer cryptographic hardware circuits using power analysis, but more recently timing information is being used to deduce the sensitive inner workings of software. The steady stream of side channel exploits coming out academia and the security community continue to demonstrate the seriousness of the problem and DARPA's current Space/Time Analysis for Cybersecurity (STAC) program indicates that we need a solution now. Let's take a look at a few real examples of information leakage through side channel attacks in web apps and learn to spot them together. If there's a hole in your bucket, then fix it, dear Henry.</p></div>

**Paper:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Paper](../papers/Security_Toolbox_for_Detecting_Novel_and_Sophisticated_Android_Malware.pdf)]&nbsp;[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhcoAX3HiNU)]
<div class="abstract"><p>This paper presents a demo of our Security Toolbox to detect novel malware in Android apps. This Toolbox is developed through our recent research project funded by the DARPA Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) project. The adversarial challenge ("Red") teams in the DARPA APAC program are tasked with designing sophisticated malware to test the bounds of malware detection technology being developed by the research and development ("Blue") teams. Our research group, a Blue team in the DARPA APAC program, proposed a "human-in-the-loop program analysis" approach to detect malware given the source or Java bytecode for an Android app. Our malware detection apparatus consists of two components: a general-purpose program analysis platform called Atlas, and a Security Toolbox built on the Atlas platform. This paper describes the major design goals, the Toolbox components to achieve the goals, and the workflow for auditing Android apps. The accompanying video illustrates features of the Toolbox through a live audit.</p></div>

- <a name="SMC2014"></a>Suresh Kothari, Akshay Deepak, Ahmed Tamrawi, Benjamin Holland, Sandeep Krishnan. **A "Human-in-the-loop" Approach for Resolving Complex Software Anomalies.** *In Proceedings of the 2014 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics [(SMC 2014)](http://smc2014.org/)*, San Diego, California, October 2014.<br/>
**Paper:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Paper](../papers/A_Human-in-the-loop_Approach_for_Resolving_Complex_Software_Anomalies.pdf)]
<div class="abstract"><p>Automated static analysis tools are widely used in identifying software anomalies, such as memory leak, unsafe thread synchronization and malicious behaviors in smartphone applications. Such anomaly-prone scenarios can be bifurcated into: "ordinary" (analysis requires relatively simple automation) and "complex" (analysis poses extraordinary automation challenges). While automated static analysis tools can resolve ordinary scenarios with high accuracy, automating the analysis of complex scenarios can be very challenging and, at times, infeasible. Even when feasible the cost for full automation can be exorbitant: either in implementing the automation or in sifting through the large number of erroneous results manually. Instead, we appeal for a "Human-in-the-loop" approach called "Amplified Reasoning Technique" (ART). While some of the existing approaches do involve human in the analysis process, the roles played by man and machine are mainly segregated. Whereas, ART puts man and machine in a "loop" in an interactive and visualization-based fashion. This paper makes an attempt to convince its readers to make their analysis of software anomalies ART-based by presenting real-world case studies of complex anomalies and how an ART based approach can be very effective in resolving them. The case studies highlight the desired characteristics of an ART based tool and the type of role it plays in amplifying human intelligence.</p></div>

**Talk:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Slides](../slides/A_Bug_or_Malware.pdf)]&nbsp;[[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J4D7YJ1IE4)]
<div class="abstract"><p>We live in an age of software problems with catastrophic consequences. An extra goto in Apple's SSL implementation comprised certificate checks for the better part of a year. An erroneous integer conversion in the Ariane 5 launch destroyed the European Space Agency rocket and its cargo valued at 500 million dollars. Often the problem is just a few lines of code and looking for it is like searching for a needle in the haystack. Moreover the problems are often so subtle that it is difficult to tell if the problem is intentionally malicious or an honest mistake. The traditional approach to malware detection fails to detect such catastrophic problems. To make matters worse, the problem can remain dormant and can easily evade testing. The recently exposed Heartbleed problem in OpenSSL has existed since 2011. It is an open challenge to discover these subtle but catastrophic problems in software. In this talk, Iowa State University researchers involved with DARPA's Automated Program Analysis for Cybersecurity (APAC) project will discuss their approach to address this challenge. This approach enables a unique combination of automated software analysis and human intelligence. The approach will be concretely demonstrated by its use to detect subtle problems in Android applications.</p></div>

## 2012

- <a name="MSThesis"></a>Benjamin Holland, Yong Guan. **Revealing Privacy in Online Social Networks - An exercise in revealing private friends.** *Unpublished*, July 2012.<br/>
**Paper:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Paper](../papers/Revealing_Privacy_in_Online_Social_Networks.pdf)]
<div class="abstract"><p>With rising privacy concerns and the widespread adoption of social media platforms, it becomes necessary to examine how much information is still exposed after privacy protection mechanisms are enabled. Malicious attackers and investigators looking to utilize social media often face privacy and platform restrictions that serve both to protect the privacy of individuals and to protect the economic livelihood of the social media platform. This work focuses on revealing private social contacts as a first step to a larger reconnaissance of a target Online Social Network (OSN) profile. In many OSNs the friends that are hidden when a user enables privacy protection mechanisms may still be discovered by visiting the profiles of the target’s friends and searching for public references to the target account. For large OSNs such as Facebook it would be unfeasible to search large portions of the network to discover friends of the target. In this work, we review existing Social Network Analysis (SNA) research to examine how it can be exploited to efficiently discover a majority of private friends. As our contribution, we propose a greedy search algorithm for enabling efficient discovery of private friends on social networking sites, which has shown a 33.6% to 41.6% improvement over a standard breadth-first search on synthetically generated social networks as real-world social networks.</p></div>

- <a name="MSThesis"></a>Benjamin Holland. **Enabling Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) in private social networks.** *[Iowa State University](https://www.iastate.edu/)*, Ames, Iowa, May 2012.<br/>
**Master's Thesis:**&nbsp;[<a href="#" class="toggle-abstract">Abstract</a>]&nbsp;[[Thesis](http://lib.dr.iastate.edu/etd/12347/)]
<div class="abstract"><p>Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) has been widely acknowledged as a critical source of valuable and cost efficient intelligence that is derived from publicly available sources. With the rise of prominent social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter that record and expose a multitude of different datasets, investigators are beginning to look at what social media has to offer the Intelligence Community (IC). Some major obstacles that OSINT analysts often face are privacy and platform restrictions that serve both to protect the privacy of individuals and to protect the economic livelihood of the social media platform. In this work we review existing social networking research to examine how it can be applied to OSINT. As our contribution, we propose a greedy search algorithm for enabling efficient discovery of private friends on social networking sites and evaluate its performance on multiple randomly generated graphs as well as a real-world social network collected by other researchers. In its breadth, this work aims to provide the reader with a broader understanding of OSINT and key concepts in social network analysis.</p></div>
